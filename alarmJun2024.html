            Over the Summer, I wanted to decrease screen time by moving my phone out of my bedroom.
            I did not have an alarm clock to fall back on if I kicked out my current waking solution 
            so I elected to try an build one using a Raspberry Pi. As always, this was easier said 
            than done.
        </p>
        <div class = "center">
            <img src = "assets/alarm_clock.jpeg" width="400">
        </div>
        
        <p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
            The design incorporates a 7-segment display to display the time, buttons to snooze or
            turn off the alarm, and a buzzer to act as the alarm itself. The code to determine when 
            the buzzer should go off was delightfully straighforward and the software side of the 
            alarm functionality was done within the hour. Incorporating the hardware took much more 
            time. The buttons and the buzzer were easy to add into the mix, but the 7-segment display 
            took much more time to get working. The final code that allowed the time to be displayed
            took 6 nested loops to streamline the setup process and allow for each segment to be 
            individually addressed within the code. Once the pins were set up, the task became trivial
            once again as taking advantage of the predefined segments was a matter of plug-and-play.
