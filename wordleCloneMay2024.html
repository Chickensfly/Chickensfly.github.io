            I wanted to create a Wordle clone to understand the difficulties that come with making
            a simple word game. Plus I love Wordle. My clone is played only through the terminal 
            and the solution word is determined in the code, a random word chosen from a list of 
            approved 5-letter possible solution words. As each guess is made, the word is returned
            to the player - a letter made lowercase if it exists within the solution and uppercase 
            if the placement of the letter is correct, otherwise the letter is discarded. 
        </p>
        <div class = "center">
            <img src = "assets/wordleguesses.png" width="400">
        </div>
        <p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
            The biggest challenge was accounting for guess words and solution words with multiple
            of the same letter. A guess of 'SHEEN' on 'SHINE' returns both the 'e's as lowercase
            since simply checking the solution for the presence of each letter does not consider
            quantity. Instead, I updated the game to account for these cases by counting each 
            appearance of each letter within the solution word. If there are repeated letter, it
            is noted and also how many of each letter appears. When the guess word is being checked
            against the solution repeated letters will be noted and given a counter which, when it
            reaches 0, will no longer accept matching letters as being a part of the solution.
