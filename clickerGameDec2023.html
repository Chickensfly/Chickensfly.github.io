            This project was my first foray into the world of Java, produced over the course
            of a month, concluding in December of 2023. The concept was to create the framework
            for a clicker game with an emphasis on engine building mechanics and storytelling. 
            The inspiration for this game comes from 2013's <i>A Dark Room</i>, a game I played
            in the browser when I was 13. <i>A Dark Room</i> initially presents itself as an
            unassuming clicker game. You are given a button to 'stoke the fire' and as
            you tend to the fire, you are exposed to more and more of the environment around you.
            Text readouts give you an apprehension of the scene around you and more buttons appear
            as you discover uses for more and more resources. You explore all of the 
            resources in your surroundings and continuously push your domain until it takes
            a small civilization to gather the materials you desire. The game ends with a triumphant
            space shuttle launch, as any self-respecting civilization requires a space program. 
        </p>

            My game draws on the impact of <i>A Dark Room</i> with the intention of creating 
            the same air of mystery. Minimal graphics and poignant storytelling was where the game 
            found it's personality. I drafted out a basic outline of the game and began work on it by
            creating the classes that would be the backbone of functionality. I wanted to create an 
            easily modifiable framework for the game so that any story could be told. The first phase
            of development consisted of creating these classes.

        <p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
            The story of the game is told through dialogue reached at critical points of resource 
            accumulation. Resources are accumulated by clicking on a 'harvest' button and each click
            gives a set amount of resources determined by the 'engines' that the player has. Resources 
            are used to purchase more engines which are used to create more resources.

            Creating a functioning game within the console was fairly straighforward. The difficulty of 
            the project came from the implementation of the graphical interface and the save/load feature.
            The GUI was built using Java's SWING library which was certainly dated and unintuitive. The 
            final GUI design of the game is not one that I was completely satisfied with, but it has all 
            the features I needed it to hold. If I were to revamp the project, I would use LWJGL which 
            would give me more flexibility if I wanted to add more features to the game and also have 
            more options to create a GUI that is cleaner and adds more to the affect of the game. The 
            save/load feature was implemented using Java persistence. I had not worked with it before so 
            it took some tinkering to get it to a working state. A rudimentary save/load came together 
            fairly quickly - rewriting classes to work with the system took much longer.

        </div>
        <p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
            An additional feature is a log of activity that is saved when the game is exited. This is 
            to verify the integrity of the code and to make troubleshooting easier, especially as the 
            game increases in complexity with more resources and engines. 
        </p>

            The final product has 3 engines with 2 resources with numerous dialogue options telling 
            the story of a doomed computer system destined to slave away until the very end. There
            are 9 possible endings, each of which is reached at different points in the game with no 
            'good' or 'bad' ending.
